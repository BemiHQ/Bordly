There are two projects in this repository: @frontend and @backend.

- Use `pnpm` instead of `npm`
- Run `make check` after making changes to format, lint, and find type errors
- Do not use `any` type in TypeScript
- Do not use `git` unless explicitly asked
- When asked "Review now", review the code changes, see if all changes are necessary, suggest refactoring or improvements
